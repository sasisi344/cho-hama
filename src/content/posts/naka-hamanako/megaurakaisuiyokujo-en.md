Thank you for visiting "Fishing! Hamanako"!

This article covers detailed information about the fishing spot, including fish species and methods that work well in each season. This article introduces **Megaura Beach**!

Megaura Beach in the Central Hamanako area is a hidden suzuki spot.

From shore, you can target suzuki and goby. From a boat, mackerel and horse mackerel caught with sabiki rigs are main targets, and it's a popular spot from summer to autumn.

Currently, it's not open as a beach, but in summer there may be wild swimmers, so be careful when fishing on the beach.

### Features of Megaura Beach

Peak season is from summer to autumn.

The main fishing area is the stone pavement area on the north side rather than the beach sand.

Summer night fishing is recommended, with suzuki and sea bass caught with bottom rigs or electric float.

In autumn, goby are easy to catch, and at night suzuki and sea bass are caught.

Since parking seems to exist but doesn't, it's tough for people coming by car from far away. But for nearby residents or two-wheeled anglers, it's a hidden spot.

### Megaura Area from Boat Fishing

The area from Washizu Bay in the south to Shotaiji Point is a relatively deep area even in Hamanako.

Hamanako's average depth is about 4.6m. The Megaura area is often over 5m, and in winter it becomes a hideout for large fish, while during high water temperature periods, bottom fish that prefer low temperatures tend to gather.

Boat fishing is advantageous because you can target maximum depth and use fish finders.

From spring to autumn, horse mackerel and mackerel sometimes form schools in deeper areas, and sabiki fishing from boats is enjoyable. Furthermore, flathead and flounder that prefer low temperatures are also "there sometimes" on the bottom.

Suzuki and sea bass don't need to target deep areas, so shore surf fishing within 3m depth is sufficient.

## Fish That Are Easy to Catch by Season

**Spring**: Suzuki, Flounder, Mackerel, Horse mackerel

Shore: Bottom rig fishing. Mackerel and horse mackerel: Boats are advantageous.

**Summer**: Mackerel, Horse mackerel, Sardine, Saury, Suzuki, Black sea bream, Sea bass, Flathead

Night fishing with electric float is recommended. Hand-sized fish are easy to catch, with many reactions, making it enjoyable.

**Autumn**: Suzuki, Sea bass, Goby, Flathead

Peak goby fishing season. They seem to be everywhere along the shore, with float fishing or front casting light fishing. For suzuki and sea bass, bottom rigs targeting drop-offs are safe.

**Winter**: Flounder, Sea bass, Suzuki, Flounder, Horse mackerel

Style becomes searching for fish at points with deep water depth and stable water temperature.

Flounder aren't absent but are treated as rare, and if targeting specifically, Outer Hamanako is better.

Famous for catches are suzuki and goby. From late summer it becomes full-scale, and both can be targeted with float fishing and light fishing, making them easy targets even for beginners.

Boats rely on fish schools due to depth, but relying on marina and tackle shop information is also an option.

### Fish Caught with Bait and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki, Goby
Recommended Bait: Green sandworms
Recommended Tackle: Rock rod about 4-5.4m, around size 1

Rod length should be at least 4m. For casting floats, 4m is easy to use, and for light fishing, 5.4m is good.

Is it difficult to target both goby and suzuki with the same rod?... This is often thought.

Goby swallow bait, so delicate bite detection isn't necessary. The trick is to move bait little by little, and when there's weight, just lift.

During the day, using acorn floats for float fishing allows casting far and easily targeting both goby and suzuki simultaneously.

### Fish Caught with Lures and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki, Sea bass
Recommended Lures: Popper, Range vibe
Recommended Tackle: 7-8ft sea bass rod

Stone pavement area: Summer day game. Beach area: Autumn night game.

In summer, if topwater lures don't produce, judge that fish aren't there or size doesn't match.

Averaging 20-30cm, sometimes SS minnows around 5-7cm with jerking work better.

The beach side allows targeting over 3m depth from shore by wading at low tide.

There are also changes like drop-offs, so efficiently searching bottom with range vibes. If activity is subtle, sinking pencils come into play.

## Surrounding Information

Going west by car from Megaura, there's Takayama Observatory.

It's a hidden spot overlooking Kosai City and Hamamatsu City, also serving as a hiking course a few minutes walk from the parking lot.

On clear days, Act Tower is visible straight ahead, and at night you can enjoy the night view.

### Summary of Megaura Beach!

Megaura Beach is a hidden spot advantageous for locals and two-wheelers.

Recommended season is autumn. During the day, goby are main, and at night you can target suzuki size.

This area is deep even within Hamanako, so you can also target deep areas by boat.

In summer, search for fish with fish finders while number fishing with sabiki. In winter, you can also target one big fish in deep areas.

To keep fishing spots clean, not only take your own trash home, but picking up other visible trash helps protect spots and anglers.

Please follow rules and manners and enjoy a fun fishing experience!
