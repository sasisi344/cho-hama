Thank you for visiting "Fishing! Hamanako"!

This article covers detailed information about the fishing spot, including fish species and methods that work well in each season.
This article introduces **Hamayu Bridge**!

Hamayu Bridge in the Central Hamanako area is a toll road connecting Shonai Peninsula and Furumito.

It's a shallow sandy area that serves as a shallow water spot for Japanese sea bass (suzuki) and black sea bream (kurodai).

Shore fishing here is a "locals' secret" type of spot, rarely crowded, and perfect for leisurely targeting suzuki during autumn nights.

By the way, the rest area at the toll gate is a hidden viewpoint.

### Features of Hamayu Bridge

Shore fishing near the bridge is good for suzuki, divided between the Shirasu side and Furumito side.

The Furumito side is shallow up to about 50m from shore. From spring to autumn, if fish are present, topwater fishing works.

During high water temperature periods, visibility may be poor, but this reduces fish caution and creates opportunities!

#### Shirasu to Kyowa Explanation

The Shirasu side spots are either near the bridge or elsewhere.

If there's a condition for choosing "which is correct?", it depends on the timing of rising and falling tides.

Rising tide doesn't matter much, but during falling tide, current flows toward the Furumito side, so for targeting migratory sea bass, consider timing and tide flow during "falling tide."

If you go from Hamayu Bridge to Kyowa-cho, fishing from a boat rather than shore allows you to target shallow areas more widely, especially recommended in summer.

You can fish from shore, but since it's generally shallow, you'll need to decide between surf fishing, float fishing, wading, or float fishing.

#### Furumito to Sahama Explanation

Sahama-cho has the flow of the Isaji River, and during autumn goby season, it gets quite busy.

The river is a goby spot up to around the 7-Eleven area, so fishing spots are quite wide.

The sea side has a revetment seawall, and since the road runs right next to it, fishing from shore is difficult.

However, boats aren't affected, so during high water temperature periods, enjoy topwater fishing for suzuki, black sea bream, and sea bass.

## Fish That Are Easy to Catch by Season at Hamayu Bridge

**Spring**: Suzuki, Sea bass

Season starts as early as February, at least from March. Target fish entering Shonai Lake after water temperature rises.

**Summer**: Suzuki, Sea bass, Black sea bream, Gima

Topwater fishing or front casting during the day. Electric float or surf fishing at night. Black sea bream and sea bass don't have resident spots, so searching by moving around works better.

**Autumn**: Suzuki, Black sea bream, Sea bass, Saury, Goby, Cuttlefish

Goby: Explore with light casting. Suzuki and sea bass: Night fishing is better. Cuttlefish are scattered, so from shore it depends on luck.

**Winter**: Sea bass

Target fish coming out of Shonai Lake. Target fish that start moving during twilight time.

Suzuki and sea bass are easy to target throughout the season.

Size fishing is best in spring and autumn; if you want numbers even if small, summer is good.

Especially in summer, hand-sized fish gather near shore, so night fishing with electric float targeting hand-sized black sea bream and sea bass is recommended.

### Fish Caught with Bait and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki
Recommended Bait: Green sandworms
Recommended Tackle: Electric float or bottom rig

For electric float, [self-standing type that can cast far](https://amzn.to/3Z8EPAH) is recommended.

When targeting suzuki, set the leader length to 1.5-2 fathoms (about 2m), adjust to a depth where it flows naturally with only the leader below the float, no split shot.

If there's no response and sea bass are splashing on the surface, reducing the leader length to half or less increases chances.

For size fishing, autumn night fishing is best!

### Fish Caught with Lures and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki, Black sea bream
Recommended Lures: Popper, Pencil bait
Recommended Tackle: About 8ft sea bass rod

Mainly topwater fishing from summer to autumn.

At low tide, it's shallow enough to want to wade, but casting from shore rocks is fine if you can get good distance.

For poppers, most work well, with 60mm size recommended for distance.

In autumn, cuttlefish are possible with squid jig rigs.

If you have patience for moving around, searching for flathead with S minnow or metal jig is also an option.

### Summary of Hamayu Bridge!

The Hamayu Bridge area is a fun place if you choose the right fishing season.

Summer night fishing allows easy number fishing of small fish, and since you only need light casting, beginners can enjoy it.

Autumn night fishing with surf fishing can allow number fishing of large fish if timing aligns.

Start with light casting, and as you get used to it, aim for size with long casts—your skills will improve as you visit more.
