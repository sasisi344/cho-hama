This article introduces **Uchiyama Coast**!

Uchiyama Coast in the Central Hamanako area is a hidden spot for suzuki and sea bass from summer to autumn.

There's no clearly designated parking, so it's roadside parking—don't park in the middle of the road.

### Features of Uchiyama Coast

Uchiyama Coast is generally a shallow sandy beach.

For fishing purposes, surf fishing and wading are suitable.

The advantage is that it's a low-competition spot, so **the searchable range is vast**.

Although the coast is protected by a bicycle path, if you enter during falling tide from high tide, you can search quite a wide area.

The advantage is that you can fish anywhere since water depth is almost constant.

Also, from here to Tazanji, there are several places along the bicycle path where you can access by car from the road side.

## Fish That Are Easy to Catch by Season at Uchiyama Coast

**Spring**: Suzuki, Sea bass

They start biting around April.

**Summer**: Suzuki, Sea bass, Yellowfin bream, Gima

This is when sight fishing during the day progresses. You can target from shore with casting without wading. Surf fishing is recommended for night fishing, but yellowfin bream and suzuki are OK during the day.

**Autumn**: Suzuki, Sea bass, Saury

Saury: The bicycle path toward Tazanji is recommended. Suzuki and sea bass: Night fishing bottom rigs are the target, and if activity is high, lures also work.

**Winter**: ━━━━

Basically off-season.

The main fishing targets are suzuki and sea bass.

During the day, topwater lure fishing is suitable, and for bait fishing, surf fishing is suitable.

At low tide, shore areas are about 1m deep, so you can wade in deep and even fly fish.

Since there's a lot of sandy bottom, black sea bream numbers are quite low.

### Fish Caught with Bait and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki, Yellowfin bream
Recommended Bait: Green sandworms
Recommended Tackle: Surf rod with 10-20g weight, 3-hook rig or bottom rig

Suzuki and yellowfin bream are main season from summer to autumn.

Commercial 3-hook rigs are fine, and you only need weight and that, so it's easy.

Since water depth has almost no variation, you can't narrow down good fishing spots, but **you have a chance wherever you cast**.

The basic method is casting far and then reeling in little by little while attracting...

Size is mainly around hand size, but you can catch numbers, so it's fun.

### Fish Caught with Lures and Recommended Tackle

Target Fish: Suzuki, Sea bass
Recommended Lures: Popper, Pencil bait
Recommended Tackle: About 8ft sea bass rod

During high water temperature periods, fish shadows are thick enough that you can see suzuki scattered from the bicycle path.

The disadvantage is that fish have no hiding places, and it's hard for anglers to narrow down target spots.

So the strategy for Uchiyama Coast is basically finding scattered individuals by moving around.

## Surrounding Information

Uchiyama Coast has a campsite.

You can use it as accommodation for fishing, or enjoy BBQ with caught fish!

It might be a bit difficult while fishing, but if you like outdoor activities, it's an option.

This facility also has glamping.

It's divided into air-conditioned container types, prepared large tents, and areas where you pitch tents in designated sections, so it accommodates from camping beginners to advanced campers.

Since summer to autumn night fishing often catches hand-sized fish, preparing beach BBQ ingredients and enjoying evening drinks is also an option.

### Summary of Uchiyama Coast!

Uchiyama Coast is a minor spot but has high potential.

Although it's wide and target spots are difficult, competition is low, so fish shadows rarely thin out.

Rather than waiting at fixed points, fishing that searches and attacks fish is suitable, so frequent movement leads to catches.

To keep fishing spots clean, not only take your own trash home, but picking up other visible trash helps protect spots and anglers.

Please follow rules and manners and enjoy a fun fishing experience!
